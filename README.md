# **_Python Image Classifier with Neural Networks_**

## About
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — based image classifier built using TensorFlow and Keras. 
The model is trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset , which contains 100 fine-grained classes of everyday objects, animals, and scenes. 
This project showcases how to preprocess data, build a CNN architecture, apply data augmentation, and evaluate the model's performance.

### Key Features
* Dataset : CIFAR-100 dataset with 100 fine-grained classes.
* Model Architecture : A deep CNN with convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and global average pooling for improved generalization.
* Data Augmentation : Random rotations, zooms, flips, and scaling to enhance model robustness.
* Training : Efficient training with early stopping and model checkpointing to save the best-performing model.
* Prediction : A utility function to classify new images and visualize predictions alongside ground truth labels.
